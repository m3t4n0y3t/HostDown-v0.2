# HostDown-v0.2


## 1 . Why did i write this tool ?
I have written this tool to apply to what I have learned from the ``` socket  in python ```
trying to strengthen my programming skills and It is not for any other reason, or at least the reasons why I can reveal it
For this I inform you from now that I am the author, I am not responsible for any illegal use of the tool
```bear the result of the attack whoever made it ```


## 2 . Who can use this tool ?
Anyone in the world can use this tool as long as he uses it for an educational purpose
or if the user is aware that it is only the person who is responsible for using it for destructive purposes.


## 3 . What makes this version of the tool powerful ?
In this version of the tool, you can start the attack in a number of ways
In the previous version, all you could do was send text strings to the destination,
which was very weak or may have little or no damage.
But in this version the situation has changed, you can launch the attack by sending messages, which are still weak as well, and you can send random values of bytes as in any other tool and you can also send any specific value of the bytes even if they are measured in megabytes.


## 4 . What are the requirements for running the tool ?
This tool has been written in the Python language version three and has been used by many libs such as :
```
os
time
threading
sys
random
socket
```
Which often does not require you to install any of them because they are installed automatically when installing Python.
Knowing that it was programmed on Windows and therefore I can not tell you whether you will need to install any of them on Linux or not, but you can search for how to install on the Internet so I wrote to you the names of libs at the top.


## 5 . How To Use This Tool ?
Initially run the program by clicking on HostDown.py twice and not by running by ```CMD```
but why ?  - i'll tell you soon.
After clicking on the program, this window should appear :
<How To Use The Script>
![Tool Intro](/Imgs/intro.PNG)
i'll press (1) to start DOS Attack and see the Options
![Attack Options](/Imgs/attack_ops.PNG)
Now you can style the attack you want.
For Example I'll do an attack on a  ```MyShraidar``` website.
I'll Enter Attack Methods IP/Port/Speed(How many Hits Per Round)/Threads(How Many Scripts Which will Run At rge same time)
![Attack Example](/Imgs/attack_test.PNG)
Then Press 'Enter' and you will see this animation loading which mean that the attack will start after 1 sec

## 6 . Run From Python  vs  Run From CMD

I do not need clarification, you can conclude it yourself

### the same path

## What has been fixed in this release ?
- The application is interrupted by an operating system program

- Keyboard Interrupt Error

- Close the connection between the destination and the user

## What is new ?

- Attacking With Random Bytes

- Attacking With Reading Binary

- Beautiful UI
